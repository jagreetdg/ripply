# üìÑ Ripply Product Requirements Document (MVP)

## üß† Overview

**Ripply** is a voice-note-based social networking platform designed for creative expression and anonymity. The MVP will allow users to create, share, and interact with short voice posts, with a strong focus on mobile-first design, user privacy, and discoverability. This document defines the step-by-step, testable tasks needed for an engineering LLM to execute the MVP using Taskmaster AI in Cursor.

---

## üöÄ Goals

- Build and launch a working MVP with:
  - User auth
  - Voice posts (creation, playback, interaction)
  - Feed and discovery
  - Voice/text comments
  - In-app notifications
  - Onboarding flow
  - JP+EN UI support
- Use Supabase and Cloudflare R2 (optional future scaling) per `STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Make all tasks granular, single-concern, and testable

---

## üîß Architecture References

- **Frontend**: Next.js / React
- **Backend**: Express.js API
- **Database**: Supabase (Free Tier)
- **Storage**: Supabase Buckets (initially), Cloudflare R2 for future migration
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend), Render/Fly.io (backend)

## üë§ User Stories (MVP)

1. I can sign up and log in using email or social login.
2. I can record a voice note (post) and share it to the feed.
3. I can browse a Home feed (following) and Explore feed (discover).
4. I can play/pause voice notes and see a waveform UI.
5. I can like posts, comment using voice or text, and follow users.
6. I can see notifications for activity on my content.
7. I can set my profile with a voice bio, photo, and cover.
8. I can post 15s ephemeral stories that autoplay and expire after 24h.
9. I can view and share other users‚Äô profiles via unique URLs.
10. I can switch the app UI between English and Japanese.
11. I can report inappropriate content.
12. I get gamified feedback when I engage (e.g. first post, streaks).
13. I can give feedback to the dev team inside the app.
