# TASKMASTER DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM SETUP GUIDE

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the comprehensive documentation system that has been set up for the Ripply project. This system ensures Taskmaster follows project-specific rules while maintaining consistency with the established architecture.

```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup
The documentation system is now fully configured. Here's what was created:

✅ **Project Rules**: `.devdocs/TASKMASTER_RULES.md` - Defines how Taskmaster should operate on this project
✅ **System Rules**: `.taskmaster/docs/SYSTEM_RULES.md` - Internal Taskmaster operation guidelines  
✅ **Templates**: Enhanced PRD templates with project-specific context
✅ **Index**: Navigation guide for all documentation

### 2. How Taskmaster Uses This System

#### Before Every Task Operation
Taskmaster automatically references:
1. **Project rules** from `.devdocs/TASKMASTER_RULES.md`
2. **Architecture patterns** from `.devdocs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. **System operation rules** from `.taskmaster/docs/SYSTEM_RULES.md`

#### During Task Creation
Taskmaster will:
- Follow established architecture patterns
- Reference relevant documentation sections
- Include security considerations
- Set appropriate dependencies
- Use correct priority levels

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating Frontend Tasks
When Taskmaster creates frontend tasks, it will:

```markdown
**Architecture Reference**: ARCHITECTURE.md - Frontend Architecture section
**Component Pattern**: Atomic design with hooks-based state management
**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create component following established folder structure
2. Implement using React Context patterns for state
3. Add proper error handling and loading states
4. Include accessibility considerations
**Security Considerations**: Input validation, secure data handling
**Testing Strategy**: Component testing with React Native Testing Library
```

### Example 2: Creating Backend Tasks
For backend tasks, Taskmaster will:

```markdown
**Architecture Reference**: ARCHITECTURE.md - Backend Architecture section  
**MVC Layer**: Service layer implementation
**Security Requirements**: Input validation, rate limiting, proper error handling
**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create service following established patterns
2. Implement controller with proper validation
3. Add route with appropriate middleware
4. Update API documentation
**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for services, integration tests for endpoints
```

## Working with PRDs

### Using the Ripply PRD Template
When creating new features, use the Ripply-specific template:

```bash
# Location: .taskmaster/templates/ripply_prd_template.txt
```

This template includes:
- Architecture context sections
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Integration patterns
- Testing strategies

### PRD → Tasks Workflow
1. **Create PRD** using the template
2. **Parse with Taskmaster** using `parse_prd` command
3. **Review generated tasks** for architecture compliance
4. **Expand complex tasks** using established patterns

---

## Quality Assurance

### Automatic Checks
The system includes automatic validation:
- ✅ All tasks reference architecture documentation
- ✅ Security considerations are included
- ✅ Dependencies follow logical order
- ✅ Implementation patterns are consistent

### Manual Review Points
Regular checks to ensure:
- Documentation stays current with code changes
- New patterns are documented
- Cross-references remain valid
- Templates evolve with project needs

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Documentation

#### Architecture Changes
Update `.devdocs/ARCHITECTURE.md` when:
- New technical patterns are established
- System architecture evolves
- Integration patterns change
- Security requirements update

#### Rule Updates
Update `.devdocs/TASKMASTER_RULES.md` when:
- New project-specific patterns emerge
- Development workflow changes
- Quality standards evolve
- Common issues are identified

#### Template Evolution
Update `.taskmaster/templates/ripply_prd_template.txt` when:
- New requirement categories emerge
- Architecture patterns change
- Security requirements evolve
- Testing strategies update

### Documentation Sync Process
1. **Detect Changes**: Monitor for new patterns in code
2. **Update Docs**: Reflect changes in relevant documentation
3. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure consistency across all docs
4. **Validate**: Test that Taskmaster still follows updated rules

---

## Advanced Features

### Research Integration
The system automatically triggers research when:
- New technologies are encountered
- Security-related tasks are created
- Performance optimization is needed
- External integrations are planned

### Context-Aware Task Generation
Taskmaster uses architectural context to:
- Determine appropriate task complexity
- Set logical dependencies
- Include relevant security measures
- Generate appropriate test strategies

### Cross-Documentation References
All tasks include:
- Links to relevant architecture sections
- References to established patterns
- Security consideration checklists
- Testing strategy guidelines

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tasks Not Following Patterns
**Symptom**: Generated tasks don't reference architecture
**Solution**: Check that `.devdocs/TASKMASTER_RULES.md` is being read
**Fix**: Ensure file permissions allow read access

#### Architecture Conflicts
**Symptom**: Tasks conflict with established patterns
**Solution**: Review and update architecture documentation
**Fix**: Sync documentation with current codebase state

#### Template Issues
**Symptom**: PRD parsing doesn't generate expected tasks
**Solution**: Check template alignment with current architecture
**Fix**: Update template to reflect current patterns

### Validation Commands
Use these to verify system health:

```bash
# Check documentation consistency
find .devdocs -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "ARCHITECTURE.md" {} \;

# Verify cross-references
grep -r "devdocs/" .taskmaster/docs/

# Validate template currency
diff .taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt .taskmaster/templates/ripply_prd_template.txt
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Documentation system is set up and ready
2. ✅ Taskmaster will now follow project-specific rules
3. ✅ Templates are available for feature development
4. ✅ Quality assurance is automated

### Ongoing Development
1. **Monitor**: Watch for new patterns as development progresses
2. **Document**: Add new patterns to architecture documentation
3. **Update**: Keep rules current with project evolution
4. **Improve**: Enhance templates based on usage

### Future Enhancements
- **Custom Commands**: Add project-specific Taskmaster commands
- **Validation Scripts**: Automate documentation consistency checks
- **Integration Tests**: Verify documentation accuracy against code
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Track documentation usage and quality
