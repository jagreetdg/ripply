# Task ID: 6
# Title: Setup Rate Limiter
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement rate limiting on all backend endpoints to prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service attacks.
# Details:
Use a rate limiting middleware like `express-rate-limit` to limit the number of requests from a single IP address within a given time window. Configure different rate limits for different endpoints based on their sensitivity.

# Test Strategy:
Test rate limiting by sending multiple requests to the same endpoint within a short period. Verify that requests are blocked after exceeding the rate limit.
