Log responses, including status code, response time, and response body (if applicable).\n3. **Centralized Log Management:** Configure the logging library to output logs to a centralized location, such as a file, a dedicated logging server (e.g., Graylog, ELK stack), or a cloud-based logging service (e.g., Datadog, Splunk).\n4. **Integrate Vercel Analytics:** Enable Vercel analytics in the Vercel project settings. Use the `vercel/analytics` package to track page views, custom events, and performance metrics.\n5. **Implement Error Tracking:** Implement error tracking using a service like Sentry or Bugsnag to capture and report unhandled exceptions and errors in the backend API.\n6. **Configure Log Levels:** Set appropriate log levels for different environments (development, staging, production).
