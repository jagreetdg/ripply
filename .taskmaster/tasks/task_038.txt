# Task ID: 38
# Title: Implement User Profile View and Edit Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 25
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement user profile view and edit functionality, allowing users to view their profile information and make changes. This includes both frontend UI elements and backend API endpoints to handle profile updates.
# Details:
1. **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   Create a user profile page displaying user information such as username, email, profile picture, cover photo, and other relevant details.
    *   Implement an edit mode for the profile page, allowing users to modify their information.
    *   Add input fields for editable profile attributes (e.g., display name, bio, location).
    *   Integrate with the profile picture and cover photo upload functionality (Task 30).
    *   Implement client-side validation for input fields to ensure data integrity.
    *   Use React forms and state management to handle user input and updates.
    *   Implement a "Save Changes" button to submit the updated profile information to the backend.
    *   Display success or error messages upon saving or encountering issues.
2.  **Backend Implementation:**
    *   Create API endpoints for retrieving user profile information (e.g., `/api/users/:userId`).
    *   Create API endpoints for updating user profile information (e.g., `/api/users/:userId`).
    *   Implement authentication and authorization to ensure users can only access and modify their own profiles.
    *   Validate the incoming data from the frontend to prevent malicious input.
    *   Update the user's profile information in the database.
    *   Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
    *   Consider using Supabase's built-in user management features to simplify profile updates.
3.  **Database Considerations:**
    *   Ensure the `users` table in Supabase includes all necessary profile attributes (e.g., display name, bio, location, profile picture URL, cover photo URL).
    *   Consider adding indexes to frequently queried profile attributes to improve performance.
    *   Implement database migrations to update the schema if necessary.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Profile View Test:**
    *   Log in as a user and navigate to the profile page.
    *   Verify that all profile information is displayed correctly.
    *   Test with different user accounts to ensure the correct profile is displayed for each user.
2.  **Profile Edit Test:**
    *   Log in as a user and navigate to the profile edit mode.
    *   Modify profile attributes and click the "Save Changes" button.
    *   Verify that the changes are saved successfully and reflected on the profile page.
    *   Test with different input values, including valid and invalid data.
    *   Verify that client-side and server-side validation are working correctly.
    *   Test error handling for invalid input or database errors.
3.  **Authorization Test:**
    *   Attempt to access or modify another user's profile.
    *   Verify that the user is not authorized to access or modify the profile.
