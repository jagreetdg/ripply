# Task ID: 39
# Title: Implement Voice Post Share Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the share feature for voice posts, allowing users to generate and share external links to specific voice posts. This includes generating a shareable link and providing options to share via various social media platforms.
# Details:
1.  **Generate Shareable Link:**
    *   Create an API endpoint that generates a unique, short URL for a given voice post ID.
    *   Use a URL shortening service (e.g., Bitly, TinyURL, or a custom solution) to create short, manageable links.
    *   Store the mapping between the voice post ID and the shortened URL in the database.
2.  **Implement Share UI:**
    *   Add a "Share" button/icon to the voice post UI.
    *   When the button is clicked, display a modal or popover with the following options:
        *   Copy the shareable link to the clipboard.
        *   Share directly to social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.) using their respective APIs or web sharing flows.
3.  **Social Media Integration:**
    *   Use social media sharing APIs or web sharing flows to pre-populate the share message with the voice post title and link.
    *   Ensure the shared link directs users to the specific voice post within the application.
4.  **Link Preview Generation:**
    *   Implement metadata tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards) on the voice post page to generate rich previews when the link is shared on social media.
    *   Include the voice post title, author, and a relevant image in the metadata.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Link Generation and Redirection:**
    *   Create a voice post and generate a shareable link.
    *   Verify that the generated link is a valid URL.
    *   Open the generated link in a new browser tab or window.
    *   Ensure that the link redirects to the correct voice post within the application.
2.  **Social Media Sharing:**
    *   Share a voice post to different social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).
    *   Verify that the shared post includes the correct title, link, and image preview.
    *   Click on the shared link and ensure it redirects to the correct voice post.
3.  **Clipboard Copy:**
    *   Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
    *   Paste the contents of the clipboard into a text editor or other application.
    *   Verify that the correct shareable link is copied to the clipboard.
4.  **Performance:**
    *   Test the link generation API endpoint with a large number of requests.
    *   Ensure that the API responds quickly and efficiently.
