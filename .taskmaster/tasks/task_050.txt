# Task ID: 50
# Title: Implement User Follow/Unfollow System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the ability for users to follow and unfollow other users. This includes updating the database to reflect these relationships and providing UI elements for users to manage their followed users.
# Details:
1.  **Database Schema Update:**
    *   Create a `followers` table in the database to store follower-followee relationships. This table should include columns for `follower_id` (user initiating the follow), `followee_id` (user being followed), and `created_at` (timestamp of when the follow action occurred).
    *   Ensure proper indexing on `follower_id` and `followee_id` for efficient querying.
2.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   Implement a `/api/follow` endpoint that accepts a `followee_id` and creates a new entry in the `followers` table.
    *   Implement an `/api/unfollow` endpoint that accepts a `followee_id` and deletes the corresponding entry from the `followers` table.
    *   Implement an `/api/followers` endpoint that returns a list of users following a specific user (accepts a `user_id` as a parameter).
    *   Implement an `/api/following` endpoint that returns a list of users that a specific user is following (accepts a `user_id` as a parameter).
3.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   Add a "Follow"/"Unfollow" button to user profiles.
    *   When the button is clicked, call the appropriate API endpoint (`/api/follow` or `/api/unfollow`).
    *   Update the button state (Follow/Unfollow) based on the API response.
    *   Implement a "Following" list on the user's profile page to display the users they are following.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Handle cases where a user tries to follow themselves.
    *   Handle cases where a user tries to follow the same user multiple times.
    *   Implement proper error messages for API failures.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Follow/Unfollow Functionality:**
    *   Verify that users can successfully follow and unfollow other users.
    *   Ensure that the `followers` table is updated correctly when a user follows or unfollows another user.
    *   Check that the "Follow"/"Unfollow" button state is updated correctly in the UI.
2.  **API Endpoint Tests:**
    *   Test the `/api/follow` endpoint with valid and invalid `followee_id` values.
    *   Test the `/api/unfollow` endpoint with valid and invalid `followee_id` values.
    *   Test the `/api/followers` and `/api/following` endpoints to ensure they return the correct lists of users.
3.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Verify that a user cannot follow themselves.
    *   Ensure that a user cannot follow the same user multiple times.
4.  **Performance:**
    *   Test the performance of the API endpoints with a large number of followers and followees.
    *   Ensure that the database queries are optimized for performance.
