# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement Silence Trimming for Voice Clips
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 45
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement silence trimming on recorded voice clips to improve audio quality and reduce storage space. This task involves analyzing audio clips and removing leading and trailing silence.
# Details:
1.  **Analyze Audio Clips:**
    *   Use an audio processing library (e.g., Librosa, WaveSurfer.js) to analyze the recorded audio clips.
    *   Detect silence at the beginning and end of the audio clip by identifying periods where the amplitude is below a certain threshold.
2.  **Implement Silence Trimming:**
    *   Implement a function to trim the silence from the beginning and end of the audio clip.
    *   Ensure that the trimming process does not remove any actual speech or important audio content.
3.  **Integrate with Voice Post and Bio Upload:**
    *   Integrate the silence trimming functionality into the voice post recording (Task 9) and voice bio upload (Task 45) processes.
    *   Apply silence trimming before uploading the audio clip to Supabase storage.
4.  **Configuration:**
    *   Make the silence threshold configurable to allow for adjustments based on different recording environments and microphone sensitivities.
    *   Consider adding a minimum silence duration to avoid trimming very short pauses within speech.
5.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where audio analysis fails or the trimming process encounters issues.
    *   Log any errors for debugging purposes.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Silence Trimming Accuracy Test:**
    *   Record voice clips with varying amounts of leading and trailing silence.
    *   Verify that the silence trimming functionality correctly removes the silence without affecting the actual speech content.
    *   Measure the amount of silence removed and compare it with the expected values.
2.  **Audio Quality Test:**
    *   Compare the audio quality of the trimmed audio clips with the original audio clips.
    *   Ensure that the trimming process does not introduce any artifacts or distortions.
    *   Use subjective listening tests to assess the perceived audio quality.
3.  **Integration Test:**
    *   Test the silence trimming functionality in the context of voice post recording and voice bio upload.
    *   Verify that the trimmed audio clips are uploaded to Supabase storage correctly.
    *   Ensure that the playback functionality works as expected with the trimmed audio clips.
4.  **Performance Test:**
    *   Measure the time taken to analyze and trim the audio clips.
    *   Optimize the silence trimming functionality to minimize processing time.
