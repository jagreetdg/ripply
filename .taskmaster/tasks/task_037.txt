# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement User and Voice Post Search Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement search functionality to allow users to search for other users and voice posts. This includes both frontend and backend implementation to handle search queries and display results.
# Details:
1.  **Backend Implementation:**
    *   Create API endpoints for searching users and voice posts (e.g., `/api/search/users?query=`, `/api/search/posts?query=`).
    *   Implement search queries in the database to find users and voice posts matching the search query. Consider using full-text search capabilities of Supabase.
    *   Implement pagination for search results.
    *   Ensure proper indexing for efficient searching.
2.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   Add a search bar in the UI.
    *   Implement search functionality to call the backend API endpoints when the user enters a search query.
    *   Display search results in a list or grid format with user profiles and voice post previews.
    *   Implement loading indicators and error handling for search requests.
    *   Implement infinite scroll or pagination for displaying large search result sets.
3.  **User Search:**
    *   Search users by username, display name, or email.
    *   Display user profiles with avatars and usernames.
4.  **Voice Post Search:**
    *   Search voice posts by title, description, or tags.
    *   Display voice post previews with audio players and author information.
5.  **Performance Considerations:**
    *   Optimize database queries for fast search results.
    *   Implement caching for frequently searched terms.
    *   Use debounce or throttling to limit the number of search requests sent to the backend.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **User Search Test:**
    *   Search for existing users by username, display name, and email.
    *   Verify that the search results display the correct user profiles.
    *   Test search with different casing and partial matches.
2.  **Voice Post Search Test:**
    *   Search for voice posts by title, description, and tags.
    *   Verify that the search results display the correct voice post previews.
    *   Test search with different casing and partial matches.
3.  **Pagination Test:**
    *   Search for a term with a large number of results.
    *   Verify that the search results are paginated correctly.
    *   Test loading more results with infinite scroll or pagination buttons.
4.  **Error Handling Test:**
    *   Test search with invalid search queries.
    *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed.
5.  **Performance Test:**
    *   Measure the time it takes to perform search queries with different data volumes.
    *   Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
