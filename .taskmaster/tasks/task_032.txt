# Title: Display Waveform UI on Voice Post Playback
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Display a waveform visualization of the audio during voice post playback. This will provide users with a visual representation of the audio content.
# Details:
1.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Integrate a waveform library (e.g., wavesurfer.js, waveform-playlist) into the frontend.
    *   Fetch the audio data for the voice post from Supabase storage.
    *   Use the waveform library to generate a waveform visualization from the audio data.
    *   Display the waveform below the voice post during playback.
    *   Synchronize the waveform display with the audio playback progress.
2.  **Backend Considerations:**
    *   Ensure the backend provides the necessary audio metadata (e.g., duration) to the frontend.
    *   Optimize audio data delivery for efficient waveform generation.
3.  **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   Design an intuitive and visually appealing waveform display.
    *   Ensure the waveform is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
    *   Provide clear visual cues for playback progress on the waveform.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Verify Waveform Display:**
    *   Play a voice post and verify that the waveform is displayed correctly.
    *   Test different voice posts with varying audio characteristics (e.g., volume, frequency) to ensure the waveform accurately represents the audio.
2.  **Test Playback Synchronization:**
    *   Play a voice post and verify that the waveform display is synchronized with the audio playback progress.
    *   Pause, resume, and seek within the audio to ensure the waveform updates accordingly.
3.  **Test Responsiveness:**
    *   Resize the browser window and verify that the waveform adapts to different screen sizes.
4.  **Test Error Handling:**
    *   Test cases where the audio data is unavailable or corrupted and verify that the app handles the errors gracefully.
