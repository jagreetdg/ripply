# Task ID: 51
# Title: Implement In-App Notification Panel
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 50
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement an in-app notification panel to display user activity such as likes, follows, and comments. This panel will provide users with a centralized location to view and manage their notifications.
# Details:
1.  **Create a Notification Panel Component:**
    *   Develop a React component to display notifications in a visually appealing manner.
    *   Design the UI to accommodate different types of notifications (likes, follows, comments).
    *   Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle a large number of notifications.
    *   Include timestamps for each notification to indicate when the activity occurred.
2.  **Fetch Notifications from the Backend:**
    *   Create an API endpoint to retrieve notifications for the current user.
    *   Implement logic to fetch notifications from the database, ordered by timestamp.
    *   Optimize the query to efficiently retrieve notifications without impacting performance.
3.  **Integrate with Push Notifications:**
    *   When a push notification is received (via Task 41), also add the notification to the in-app notification panel.
    *   Ensure that the notification panel is updated in real-time when new notifications arrive.
4.  **Implement Mark as Read Functionality:**
    *   Allow users to mark individual notifications as read.
    *   Implement an API endpoint to update the notification status in the database.
    *   Provide a "Mark All as Read" button to clear all notifications.
5.  **Link to Relevant Content:**
    *   Make notifications clickable, linking users to the relevant content (e.g., the voice post that was liked, the user who followed them, the comment that was made).
6.  **Visual Indicators:**
    *   Display a badge on the notification panel icon to indicate the presence of unread notifications.
    *   Use different icons or styling to differentiate between notification types.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Notification Display Test:**
    *   Log in as a user and perform actions that trigger notifications (e.g., like a voice post, follow another user, receive a comment).
    *   Verify that the notifications are displayed correctly in the notification panel.
    *   Check that the timestamps are accurate and the notifications are ordered correctly.
2.  **Mark as Read Functionality Test:**
    *   Mark individual notifications as read and verify that their status is updated correctly.
    *   Click the "Mark All as Read" button and ensure that all notifications are marked as read.
    *   Refresh the page and verify that the notification status persists.
3.  **Link Navigation Test:**
    *   Click on different notifications and ensure that they navigate to the correct content.
    *   Verify that the correct voice post, user profile, or comment is displayed.
4.  **Real-time Update Test:**
    *   Use two different user accounts. Have one user perform an action that generates a notification for the other user.
    *   Verify that the notification appears in the second user's notification panel in real-time without requiring a page refresh.
5.  **Performance Test:**
    *   Simulate a large number of notifications and verify that the notification panel loads efficiently without performance issues.
