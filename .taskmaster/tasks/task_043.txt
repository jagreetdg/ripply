# Task ID: 43
# Title: Add PWA Support (Install Prompt, Offline Caching)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement PWA support to enable install prompt and offline caching capabilities. This will enhance user experience by allowing users to install the app and access content even when offline.
# Details:
1.  **Install PWA Dependencies:** Add `next-pwa` package to the project.
2.  **Configure `next-pwa`:** Configure `next-pwa` in `next.config.js` to enable service worker generation and caching strategies.
3.  **Implement Install Prompt:** Detect when the app is running in a browser and prompt the user to install the app. Use `beforeinstallprompt` event to handle the install prompt.
4.  **Implement Offline Caching:** Configure caching strategies for static assets, API responses, and dynamic content using the service worker. Use `cacheFirst` or `networkFirst` strategies as appropriate.
5.  **Test Offline Functionality:** Verify that the app can be accessed and used offline. Ensure that cached content is available and that API requests are handled gracefully when offline.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Installability Test:**
    *   Open the app in a browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).
    *   Verify that the install prompt appears after a few seconds.
    *   Install the app and ensure it is added to the home screen.
2.  **Offline Caching Test:**
    *   Open the app and navigate to different pages.
    *   Disable the network connection (go offline).
    *   Verify that the app continues to function and that cached content is displayed correctly.
    *   Test with different types of content (static assets, API responses, dynamic content).
3.  **Service Worker Update Test:**
    *   Make changes to the app and deploy a new version.
    *   Open the app and verify that the service worker is updated automatically.
    *   Ensure that the new version of the app is loaded correctly.
