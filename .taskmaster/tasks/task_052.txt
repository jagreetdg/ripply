# Task ID: 52
# Title: Implement i18n with English/Japanese Language Toggle
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement internationalization (i18n) support in the application, allowing users to switch between English and Japanese languages. This includes setting up the i18n library, configuring language files, and implementing a language toggle in the UI.
# Details:
1.  **Install i18n Library:**
    *   Install a suitable i18n library for Next.js, such as `next-i18next` or `react-intl`.
2.  **Configure i18n:**
    *   Create language files (e.g., `en.json`, `ja.json`) containing translations for all text in the application.
    *   Configure the i18n library to load these language files and set the default language to English.
    *   Set up locale detection to automatically determine the user's preferred language based on browser settings or user preferences.
3.  **Implement Language Toggle:**
    *   Add a language toggle component in the UI (e.g., a dropdown menu or a button) that allows users to switch between English and Japanese.
    *   Update the application's locale when the user selects a different language.
4.  **Translate Text:**
    *   Replace all hardcoded text in the application with calls to the i18n library to retrieve the appropriate translation based on the current locale.
    *   Ensure that all text, including labels, messages, and error messages, is translated.
5.  **Handle Plurals and Gender:**
    *   If necessary, implement support for plurals and gender-specific translations using the i18n library's features.
6.  **Optimize for SEO:**
    *   Configure the i18n library to generate language-specific URLs for SEO purposes (e.g., `/en/home`, `/ja/home`).

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Language Switching Test:**
    *   Verify that users can switch between English and Japanese languages using the language toggle.
    *   Ensure that all text in the application is updated to the selected language.
2.  **Translation Accuracy Test:**
    *   Review all translations to ensure they are accurate and grammatically correct.
    *   Pay special attention to translations that involve plurals, gender, or cultural nuances.
3.  **Locale Detection Test:**
    *   Test the locale detection functionality to ensure that the application correctly detects the user's preferred language based on browser settings or user preferences.
4.  **SEO Test:**
    *   Verify that the application generates language-specific URLs for SEO purposes.
    *   Check that search engines can crawl and index the different language versions of the application.
