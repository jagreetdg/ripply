# Task ID: 48
# Title: Build Story viewer with autoplay functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 47, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a story viewer with autoplay functionality to automatically play through a sequence of voice stories. This includes UI components for displaying stories and controls for pausing/resuming autoplay.
# Details:
1.  **Create Story Viewer Component:**
    *   Develop a React component to display voice stories in a sequence.
    *   Fetch story data, including voice post URLs and user information.
    *   Implement UI elements for displaying the current story, such as the author's avatar and username.
2.  **Implement Autoplay Functionality:**
    *   Use `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to automatically advance to the next story after a set duration (e.g., 5 seconds).
    *   Provide a pause/resume button to control the autoplay.
    *   Implement logic to handle the end of the story sequence, either looping back to the beginning or stopping the autoplay.
3.  **Integrate with Voice Story Recorder:**
    *   Ensure compatibility with the voice story recorder (Task 47) for seamless story creation and viewing.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement error handling for cases where a story fails to load or play.
5.  **Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure the story viewer is accessible to users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Autoplay Functionality Test:**
    *   Verify that the story viewer automatically advances to the next story after the specified duration.
    *   Test the pause/resume functionality to ensure it correctly pauses and resumes the autoplay.
    *   Check that the story sequence loops correctly or stops at the end, as designed.
2.  **Voice Story Playback Test:**
    *   Ensure that voice stories play correctly within the story viewer.
    *   Test the audio quality and volume.
3.  **Error Handling Test:**
    *   Simulate errors during story loading or playback and verify that appropriate error messages are displayed.
4.  **Responsiveness Test:**
    *   Test the story viewer on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it is responsive and displays correctly.
5. **Integration Test:**
 * Verify that the story viewer correctly displays voice stories uploaded via Task 20.
