# Task ID: 62
# Title: Build Voice Post Preview Screen
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a voice post preview screen where users can listen to their recording, see the waveform visualization, and confirm or re-record before publishing. This screen allows users to review their voice post before making it public.
# Details:
1.  **Create UI Component:**
    *   Develop a new React component for the voice post preview screen.
    *   Include an audio player to play the recorded voice post.
    *   Integrate the waveform visualization component (from Task 32) to display the audio waveform.
    *   Add buttons for 'Confirm' and 'Re-record'.
2.  **Audio Playback:**
    *   Load the recorded audio data into the audio player.
    *   Implement play/pause functionality.
    *   Synchronize the waveform visualization with the audio playback.
3.  **'Confirm' Action:**
    *   Upon confirmation, navigate the user to the voice post publishing flow (Task 47).
    *   Pass the audio data to the publishing flow.
4.  **'Re-record' Action:**
    *   Upon re-record, navigate the user back to the voice post recorder (Task 9).
    *   Clear the existing audio data.
5.  **Styling and Responsiveness:**
    *   Ensure the preview screen is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Audio Playback Test:**
    *   Record a voice post and navigate to the preview screen.
    *   Verify that the audio plays correctly in the preview screen.
    *   Check that the waveform visualization is displayed and synchronized with the audio playback.
2.  **'Confirm' Action Test:**
    *   Confirm the voice post and verify that the user is navigated to the publishing flow.
    *   Ensure that the audio data is passed correctly to the publishing flow.
3.  **'Re-record' Action Test:**
    *   Click the 'Re-record' button and verify that the user is navigated back to the voice post recorder.
    *   Check that the existing audio data is cleared.
4.  **UI Responsiveness Test:**
    *   Test the preview screen on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it is responsive and visually appealing.
