# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Refined Trending/Popular Posts Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 20, 33
# Priority: low
# Description: Refine the trending/popular posts algorithm to consider recency, user engagement, and content quality. Implement a scoring system and caching mechanism to optimize performance and ensure accurate trending results.
# Details:
1.  **Refine Trending Algorithm:**
    *   Incorporate recency into the trending score. Newer posts should have a higher initial score.
    *   Weight user engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) based on their relative importance.
    *   Consider content quality by analyzing audio characteristics (e.g., clarity, length, uniqueness).
    *   Implement a decay function to reduce the score of older posts over time.
2.  **Implement Scoring System:**
    *   Assign numerical scores to each post based on the trending algorithm.
    *   Store the trending score in the database or a caching layer.
    *   Update the score periodically (e.g., every hour) using a background job or scheduled task.
3.  **Implement Caching Mechanism:**
    *   Cache the trending posts in Redis or a similar in-memory data store.
    *   Use a Least Recently Used (LRU) or Time-To-Live (TTL) eviction policy to manage the cache size.
    *   Invalidate the cache when new posts are created, liked, shared, or commented on.
4.  **Integrate with Explore Feed:**
    *   Update the Explore Feed to use the refined trending algorithm and cached trending posts.
    *   Ensure the Explore Feed displays a mix of random and trending posts.
5.  **Optimize Performance:**
    *   Profile the trending algorithm and identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   Optimize database queries and caching strategies to minimize latency.
    *   Implement pagination and lazy loading to improve the user experience.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Algorithm Accuracy Test:**
    *   Create a set of test posts with varying recency, engagement, and content quality.
    *   Verify that the trending algorithm ranks the posts correctly based on the defined criteria.
    *   Compare the trending scores with expected values to ensure accuracy.
2.  **Caching Test:**
    *   Verify that trending posts are cached correctly in Redis or the chosen caching layer.
    *   Measure the cache hit rate and latency of retrieving trending posts from the cache.
    *   Test cache invalidation when new posts are created, liked, shared, or commented on.
3.  **Performance Test:**
    *   Measure the time it takes to calculate the trending scores for a large number of posts.
    *   Profile the trending algorithm and identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   Optimize database queries and caching strategies to minimize latency.
4.  **Explore Feed Integration Test:**
    *   Verify that the Explore Feed displays a mix of random and trending posts.
    *   Ensure the trending posts in the Explore Feed are ranked correctly based on the refined algorithm.
    *   Test pagination and lazy loading in the Explore Feed.
