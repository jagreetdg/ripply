# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Logging and Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement centralized logging for the backend API and integrate Vercel analytics to monitor application performance and user behavior. This will enable effective debugging, performance analysis, and proactive issue resolution.
# Details:
1. **Choose a Logging Library:** Select a suitable logging library for Node.js (e.g., Winston, Morgan, Bunyan) that supports different log levels (debug, info, warn, error) and customizable output formats.
2. **Implement Logging Middleware:** Create Express.js middleware to log incoming requests, including request method, URL, headers, and body. Log responses, including status code, response time, and response body (if applicable).
3. **Centralized Log Management:** Configure the logging library to output logs to a centralized location, such as a file, a dedicated logging server (e.g., Graylog, ELK stack), or a cloud-based logging service (e.g., Datadog, Splunk).
4. **Integrate Vercel Analytics:** Enable Vercel analytics in the Vercel project settings. Use the `vercel/analytics` package to track page views, custom events, and performance metrics.
5. **Implement Error Tracking:** Implement error tracking using a service like Sentry or Bugsnag to capture and report unhandled exceptions and errors in the backend API.
6. **Configure Log Levels:** Set appropriate log levels for different environments (development, staging, production). Use debug level for detailed debugging information in development, and info/warn/error levels for production.
7. **Secure Sensitive Information:** Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) is not logged. Sanitize or mask sensitive data before logging.
8. **Implement Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely. Use a library like `rotating-file-stream` to automatically rotate log files based on size or time intervals.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Verify Request Logging:** Send requests to different API endpoints and verify that the requests are logged with the correct information (method, URL, headers, body).
2. **Verify Response Logging:** Verify that responses are logged with the correct information (status code, response time, body).
3. **Verify Log Levels:** Ensure that log levels are correctly configured for different environments. Verify that debug logs are only enabled in development.
4. **Verify Error Tracking:** Simulate errors and exceptions in the backend API and verify that they are captured and reported by the error tracking service.
5. **Verify Vercel Analytics Integration:** Deploy the application to Vercel and verify that page views and custom events are being tracked in the Vercel analytics dashboard.
6. **Test Log Rotation:** Generate a large amount of log data and verify that log rotation is working correctly.
7. **Test Centralized Logging:** Check the centralized logging system to ensure logs are being sent and stored correctly.
