    *   Test the voice post preview functionality with different voice posts.
    *   Ensure that users can successfully listen to voice posts and interact with the preview feed.
    *   Verify that the call to action within the preview feed encourages users to create their own voice posts.
3.  **Analytics Verification:**
    *   Verify that user clicks on the CTAs are correctly tracked using analytics.
    *   Monitor conversion rates to assess the effectiveness of the landing page and CTAs.
4.  **Responsiveness Testing:**
