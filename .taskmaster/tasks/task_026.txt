# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement CAPTCHA for Signup/Login
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate CAPTCHA (e.g., reCAPTCHA) into the user signup and login flows to prevent bot registrations and automated attacks. This will enhance the security and integrity of the platform by reducing spam and fake accounts.
# Details:
1. **Choose a CAPTCHA Provider:** Select a CAPTCHA provider (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA v2/v3, hCaptcha) based on security, user experience, and cost considerations.
2. **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Include the CAPTCHA script in the signup and login forms.
    *   Display the CAPTCHA widget to the user.
    *   Handle user interaction with the CAPTCHA widget.
    *   Send the CAPTCHA response token to the backend for verification.
3. **Backend Integration:**
    *   Create an API endpoint to verify the CAPTCHA response token with the CAPTCHA provider's API.
    *   Implement server-side validation to ensure the CAPTCHA response is valid before processing the signup or login request.
    *   Handle cases where the CAPTCHA verification fails (e.g., display an error message to the user).
4. **Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   Provide clear and user-friendly error messages if the CAPTCHA verification fails.
    *   Implement retry mechanisms for CAPTCHA verification.
5. **Configuration:**
    *   Store CAPTCHA API keys and secrets securely using environment variables.
    *   Make CAPTCHA configurable (e.g., enable/disable CAPTCHA, adjust difficulty level).

# Test Strategy:
1. **Signup Flow:**
    *   Verify that the CAPTCHA widget is displayed on the signup form.
    *   Test successful signup with a valid CAPTCHA response.
    *   Test failed signup with an invalid or missing CAPTCHA response.
    *   Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
2. **Login Flow:**
    *   Verify that the CAPTCHA widget is displayed on the login form.
    *   Test successful login with a valid CAPTCHA response.
    *   Test failed login with an invalid or missing CAPTCHA response.
    *   Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
3. **Automated Testing:**
    *   Implement automated tests to simulate bot behavior and verify that CAPTCHA effectively blocks automated signup/login attempts.
4. **Load Testing:**
    *   Perform load testing to ensure that CAPTCHA integration does not negatively impact the performance of the signup/login flows.
5. **Accessibility Testing:**
    *   Ensure that the CAPTCHA implementation is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., provide alternative CAPTCHA options).
