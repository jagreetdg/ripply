# Task ID: 44
# Title: Deploy Frontend and Backend to Production
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel and the Express.js backend to Railway. This task ensures the application is live and accessible to users.
# Details:
1. **Vercel Frontend Deployment:**
   - Configure Vercel project settings to connect to the Next.js repository.
   - Set up environment variables in Vercel to match the frontend's requirements (e.g., API endpoints).
   - Trigger a deployment through Vercel's Git integration or CLI.
   - Verify successful deployment by accessing the Vercel-provided URL.
2. **Railway Backend Deployment:**
   - Create a new project in Railway and connect it to the Express.js backend repository.
   - Configure environment variables in Railway to match the backend's requirements (e.g., database connection string, API keys).
   - Deploy the backend application through Railway's Git integration or CLI.
   - Verify successful deployment by checking the Railway logs and accessing the backend API endpoints.
3. **Domain Configuration:**
   - Configure a custom domain for both the frontend and backend (if applicable).
   - Update DNS records to point to the Vercel and Railway deployments.
4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up monitoring and logging for both the frontend and backend to track performance and errors.
   - Integrate with tools like Sentry or Datadog for error tracking and performance monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Frontend Verification:**
   - Access the Vercel-deployed frontend URL.
   - Verify that the landing page loads correctly and all components are functional.
   - Test user authentication flow (signup, login, logout).
   - Check that data is being fetched and displayed correctly from the backend.
   - Ensure the application is responsive on different screen sizes.
2. **Backend Verification:**
   - Access the Railway-deployed backend API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
   - Verify that the API endpoints return the expected responses.
   - Test database connectivity and data retrieval.
   - Check rate limiting functionality by sending multiple requests.
3. **End-to-End Testing:**
   - Perform end-to-end testing by interacting with the frontend and verifying that data is being passed correctly to the backend and vice versa.
   - Monitor logs and error tracking tools to identify any issues.
